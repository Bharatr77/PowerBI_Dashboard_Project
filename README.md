# PowerBI_Supply_Chain_Report_Project

## Project Overview
This project involves creating an end-to-end Power BI sales reporting dashboard that visualizes key sales metrics, supply‑chain performance, and business insights for decision‑making.

## Objectives
- Build interactive sales and supply‑chain dashboards.
- Enable data‑driven analysis of revenue, product performance, and distribution.
- Provide actionable insights for business improvement.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop** – data modeling & visualization.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – custom calculations & measures.
- **SQL Server / Excel** – data source.
- **GitHub** – version control & project management.

## Project Requirements
1. **Data Sources**: SQL database or Excel files containing sales & supply‑chain data.
2. **Data Model**: Star‑schema with fact tables (Sales, Inventory) and dimension tables (Date, Product, Customer).
3. **Visualizations**: 
   - Sales KPI dashboard (revenue, profit, YoY growth).
   - Supply‑chain report (order fulfillment, inventory levels).
   - Interactive slicers for date, region, product category.
4. **Performance**: Optimized DAX queries & data refresh settings.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Import**: Connect Power BI to source files and load tables.
2. **Data Transformation**: Clean & shape data using Power Query (remove duplicates, handle nulls).
3. **Model Building**: Create relationships between fact & dimension tables.
4. **DAX Measures**: Develop calculations for total sales, margin, % growth, etc.
5. **Dashboard Design**: Arrange visuals, apply conditional formatting, add tooltips.
6. **Testing**: Validate reports with sample data & user acceptance.

## Challenges Faced
- Handling large data volumes and optimizing query performance.
- Designing complex DAX measures for accurate KPI calculations.
- Ensuring responsive dashboard layout for different screen sizes.

## Insights Gained
- Visualizing sales trends helped identify seasonal spikes and under‑performing products.
- Supply‑chain analytics revealed bottlenecks in order processing.
- Importance of proper data modeling for efficient reporting.
